<p>Design and optimisation has long been considered as an art. Optimisation is considered as the next step after designing a new system. At this lab, we investigate methods and tools to integrate these processes tightly. Multi-disciplinary optimisation &#40;MDO&#41; techniques which originated in Aerospace applications and were later adopted by many industries &#40;especially automobile engineering&#41; are one example of this.</p>
<p>At this lab, we apply formal optimisation techniques to problems in the area of Aerospace engineering. Past projects include airfoil optimisation, multi-modal wing optimisation, satellite scheduling algorithms and launch vehicle trajectory optimisation.</p>

<p>I hold a Dual Degree &#40;BTech &#43; MTech&#41; in <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in">Aerospace Engineering</a> from IIT-Bombay as well as a DPhil in <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis">Numerical Analysis</a> from the University of Oxford. Currently I am working as an Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology &#40;<a href="https://www.iist.ac.in">IIST</a>&#41; in the Department of Aerospace Engineering.</p>
<p>My doctoral work involved use of automatic differentiation techniques to develop linear and adjoint versions of finite volume CFD solvers. The work was extended to the calculation of Hessian also. The gradient information thus obtained was used for uncertainty quantification using a novel <em>Inexpensive Monte Carlo</em> approach.</p>
<p>I worked in the area of Multi-disciplinary Optimisation at the Centre for Aerospace Systems Design and Engineering &#40;<a href="https://www.casde.iitb.ac.in">CASDE</a>&#41; under the guidance with Prof. K Sudhakar and Prof. P Mujumdar. A Y shaped inlet duct of an aircraft was optimised for exit distortion using mixed-fidelity approach. Various lecture materials were developed and delivered to various Aerospace organisations in India as part of this activity.</p>
<p>Prior to that I developed a framework for structured multi-block finite volume CFD solvers using distributed memory parallel computing model as part of my graduate project with Prof. Shevare at IIT-Bombay.</p>
